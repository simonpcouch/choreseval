I passed the following prompt to Claude 3.7 Sonnet:

----

Please write me a shiny app "Eval sample json generator" that will help me quickly write json files. It should have two columns in the UI.

LHS:

* A free text input `id` that's one line, with ghost text "e.g. 'cli-sprintf'"
* A free text input `user` that's a few lines
* A free text input `target` that's a few lines

RHS:

* A multiple-choice `helper` with options NA (default), "cli", "roxygen", and "testthat", or a free text "Other".
* A free text input `source`
* A multiple-choice `parsable` that's either "Yes" or "No", defaulting to "Yes".

On the bottom RHS, there's a "Submit" button that, when clicked, writes all of the inputted data to a json file using `jsonlite`, shows a status message "Sample written to file!", and clears the inputs so that they're ready to accept a new sample. Write the resulting file to `data-raw/chores-dataset/{id}.json`.
